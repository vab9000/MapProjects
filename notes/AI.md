The plan for the AI is to make it extremely stratified. By this I mean that a given AI should have to do minimal calculations, instead delegating to other AIs as much as possible. This both is for ease of programming, making the AI smarter (without needing immense amounts of play testing), and representing reality.

For example, instead of a ruler commanding troops directly, they assign a directive to an army (attack that area, defend that area, suppress rebels in that area, etc.), which the army AI will figure out how to do, taking into account the personality, capability of the general.
