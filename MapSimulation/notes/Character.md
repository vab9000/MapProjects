# Character

_A character representing a single person has various attributes. They are also one of fundamental entities that can make decisions._

# WIP (thoughts):

## Identifiers

A character has a few identifiers that are mostly tied to what pop they are originally from.

These include:
* Culture
* Religion
* Estate

These can change during a character's lifetime.

## Stress

A character has a stress level that will change as certains things happen to them and they do certain things.

A high stress level will lower a character's health as well as make them act more erratically (i.e. make worse decisions).
However, a high stress level will also make them gain less stress, to represent them becoming better at coping with stress.
Of course, certain combinations of personality traits will make stess spirals possible, but that will be intended.

## Personality Traits

A character can have multiple personality traits that affect their decision making, stress gain, and interactios with other characters.

Groups:

* Brave, Cowardly (How likely are they to fold to intimidation)
* Calm, Irritable (How much does negative opinion affect their decision making)
* Ambitious, Content (How much they value achieving their goals)
* Lazy, Diligent (How hard will they personally work to achieve their goals)
* Forgiving, Vengeful (How quickly does negative opinion decay for them)
* Generous, Greedy (How much do they value money)
* Gregarious, Shy (How capable are they at interacting with others)
* Honest, Deceitful (How capable are they of acting against their opinion)
* Humble, Arrogant (How much do they consider other people's opinions)
* Just, Arbitrary (How much logic do they put into their decision making)
* Patient, Impatient (How quickly will they seek to achieve their goals)
* Temperate, Gluttonous (How much do they value material pleasures)
* Trusting, Paranoid (How much does positive opinion affect their decision making)
* Zealous, Cynical (How much value do they put in their faith, culture, or other factors)
* Compassionate, Callous, Sadistic (How much do they care about others' wellbeing)
* Fickle, Stubborn, Eccentric (How much do quickly do they change their mind about something)

## Goals

A character can have goals, assuming they have some level of political power, or are part of a dynasty or family that has some.

Achieving goals will lower a character's stress. However, going long periods of time without achieving any goals will cause stress gain as well as give them the opportunity to rethink their goals and get new ones.

Goals can be broken down into two categories, political and personal.
Political goals are those that involve things such as gaining independence, conquest, or pressing a claim to a throne.
Personal goals involve things such as becoming a better commander, wooing a lover, or killing a rival.

## Legacy Traits

Legacy traits are those that represent how a character is viewed by others.
A character can only have on legacy trait at a time, and a new one will be reevaluated after large events (e.g. coming of age, ascending a throne)

Examples:
* Child prodigy (for a character that is still a child and is seen as being very intelligent for their age)
* Feeble puppet (for a ruler that is not competent enough to rule alone)
* Firm ruler (for a ruler that has ruled for a long time without giving any ground to vassals, factions, etc.)

## Skill traits

Skill traits represent certain tasks or roles that a character is good at.

Skill traits also have a level of experience which a character has in them.
As time passes the amount of experience a character has in skill traits will decay, however, using the skills represented by the skill traits will bring the experience back up.

Examples:

* Guerilla Commander (ability to lead a small army without supply in de facto friendly territory (e.g. same culture, religion, etc.))
* Negotiator (ability to make mutually beneficial deals with other countries)
* Steward (ability to oversee projects like construction efficiently (i.e. prevent corruption))
