# Tags

A tag is a collective of people operating some sort of governance system.

## Leaders

A tag has a set of leaders, each with designated powers.
A leader can either be a character or a council of sorts.
The specific powers which a tag has access to depend on the tag.
Certain types of leaders will be better at wielding certain powers (e.g. a merchant will be better at economic policy).
An individual leader cannot execute more than one power at a time if they are a character, but they can still be designated more than one power.
In the case that a leader is designated more powers than they can execute, they can delegate those powers to other characters.
In this sense, it can be thought that designated powers merely represent what guaranteed powers are.
For example, in 18th century France, the King would have all designated powers because it was an absolute monarchy,
but in the Maratha Empire, the Prime Minister would have some powers and the Emperor would have others.

Examples of designated powers:
* Economic policy
* Army command
* Diplomacy

Givin characters or councils with members from certain pops, will make those pops happier, giving a reason to stratify power, although this would make the state weaker.
