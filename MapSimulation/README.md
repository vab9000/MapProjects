# MapSimulation

## Instructions

### Dependencies

1. Download OpenCV for C++ and put the include and x64 folders, and the OpenCVConfig.cmake and OpenCVConfig-version.cmake
files in a folder called libs/opencv in the main directory.

2. Download the glad library and put the include and src folders in a folder called libs/glad in the main directory.

## Building

Use the cmake CMakeLists.txt to build the project.

## Goals

Implement a political map simulation akin to Paradox Interactive games, but purely simulation, without any game.
